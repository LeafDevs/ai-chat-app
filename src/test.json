    "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this user query. The user asked, \"What is AI? What makes it so significant in todays world?\" So I need to first understand what they need. They want a definition of AI and reasons why it's important now.\n\nFirst, I called the web_search tool with the query \"What is AI and why is it significant in today's world 2025\". The search results came back with five URLs. Let me go through each to extract the relevant information.\n\nStarting with the first result from Built In: It mentions that generative AI has been a big part of AI's evolution, with models like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc. They talk about how AI is changing roles in daily life, from household tasks to workplace efficiency. So this gives a definition and current significance.\n\nSecond result from University of California: It lists 9 benefits of AI in 2025, like route planning, digital assistants, improved shopping experiences. So here, the significance is about efficiency and convenience.\n\nThird result from Microsoft: Talks about AI trends in 2025, models becoming faster and more efficient. Frontier models handle various tasks, specialized models for specific industries. This highlights advancements and applications.\n\nFourth result from McKinsey: They mention AI high performers (6% of respondents) seeing significant value through EBIT impact, redesigning workflows, scaling faster. So it's about business impact and transformation.\n\nFifth result from Phrase: Says AI is a game-changer for global businesses, here to stay. Explains what it is, benefits, future.\n\nNow, I need to synthesize this info into a coherent answer. The user wants a clear definition of AI and why it's significant today. Let me structure it.\n\nDefinition: AI is systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, like learning, problem-solving, understanding language. The search results mention generative AI models (like ChatGPT), so maybe AI here refers to machine learning and generative models as part of the broader field.\n\nSignificance in today's world (2025): From the results, key points are:\n\n- Generative AI models (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) are widespread, enabling text, audio, images.\n- AI in daily life: household tasks, digital assistants, personalized shopping.\n- Business impact: EBIT improvements, workflow redesign, scaling faster (McKinsey).\n- Efficiency: route planning, schedule management, smarter search results.\n- AI as a game-changer for businesses and industries.\n\nWait, the user said \"todays world\", but the current date is 11/6/2025, so the search results are up to 2025. The answer should reflect the current state as per 2025.\n\nSo the answer should start with a simple definition, then list the significance points from the search results.\n\nLet me check if the search results have a clear definition. The Phrase blog says \"AI is a game-changer for global businesses and is here to stay\" but doesn't give a detailed definition. The Built In article mentions generative AI models, but maybe the definition is more general.\n\nWait, the user is asking \"What is AI?\" so I need to define it. The search results might not have a comprehensive definition, but from the context, AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can mimic human intelligence for tasks like learning, problem-solving, data analysis.\n\nFrom the first result: \"generative AI has spearheaded the latest chapter in AI’s evolution\". So AI here is the broader field, with generative models as a subset.\n\nSo the definition: AI (Artificial Intelligence) refers to computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, understanding language, and generating content. This includes machine learning models, natural language processing, and generative AI like ChatGPT and Gemini.\n\nSignificance: Why it's significant today (2025):\n\n1. **Widespread Adoption**: Generative AI models (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) are now integrated into daily life, handling tasks from text generation to image creation, making AI accessible to businesses and individuals.\n\n2. **Business Transformation**: Companies using AI report significant EBIT improvements (up to 5%+), streamlined workflows, and faster scaling. McKinsey highlights that 6% of organizations have seen \"transformative innovation\" via AI.\n\n3. **Enhanced Efficiency**: AI optimizes routines (e.g., route planning, digital assistants), personalizes experiences (e.g., smarter search results), and automates repetitive tasks, boosting productivity.\n\n4. **Cross-Industry Impact**: From healthcare to retail, AI drives innovation by enabling data-driven decisions, predictive analytics, and tailored solutions.\n\n5. **Economic and Societal Shifts**: AI is reshaping job markets, creating new opportunities, and becoming a core driver of global competitiveness, with organizations that integrate AI early gaining a strategic edge.\n\nI need to make sure the answer is concise and uses the info from the search results without adding external knowledge. Let me check each point against the search results.\n\nFor example, the McKinsey result mentions EBIT impact and 6% of respondents as high performers. The Microsoft article talks about faster models and specialized use cases. The University of California mentions route planning and digital assistants.\n\nSo the answer should be structured with a definition first, then the significance points as bullet points or a paragraph.\n\nWait, the user wants a response after the tool call. The previous step was the tool call, then the tool response was given. Now I need to generate the answer based on those results.\n\nI should start by stating the definition, then the significance. Let me draft it.\n\n\"AI (Artificial Intelligence) refers to systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and processing language. In today's world (2025), AI has become significant due to its transformative impact across multiple domains:\n\n1. **Widespread Adoption of Generative AI**: Models like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude are now integral to daily life, enabling text, audio, and image generation at scale.\n2. **Business Efficiency**: Organizations using AI report EBIT improvements of 5% or more, with 6% of companies achieving 'significant value' through workflow redesign and faster scaling.\n3. **Enhanced Personalization and Automation**: AI optimizes tasks like route planning, manages digital schedules, and tailors shopping experiences, making services more efficient and user-friendly.\n4. **Cross-Industry Innovation**: From healthcare to retail, AI drives data-driven decisions and predictive capabilities, accelerating innovation and competitiveness.\n\nAs highlighted by recent surveys and industry trends, AI is no longer a niche technology but a cornerstone of modern business and daily life, reshaping how organizations operate and individuals interact with the world.\"\n\nThis covers the key points from the search results. Let me check if all the sources are properly represented. The first result (Built In) covers generative AI and daily life roles. The University of California mentions benefits like route planning. Microsoft talks about model efficiency and use cases. McKinsey gives the business impact stats. Phrase emphasizes AI as a game-changer.\n\nYes, this answer seems to capture the essence. I'll format it as a concise response without markdown, just plain text.",
